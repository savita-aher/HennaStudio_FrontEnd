## HennaBloom Studio 
HennaBloom Studio is a simple web app where customers can browse henna designs and place orders. 
The artist uses a private admin dashboard to manage designsâ€”adding, editing, or deleting them. 
Built with a clean, minimalist interface and modular architecture, the app showcases real-world CRUD 
functionality, seamless frontend-backend integration. 
Itâ€™s built with React, Express, MongoDB, and Axios to keep everything connected and easy to use.
