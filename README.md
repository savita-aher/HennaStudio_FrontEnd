## 🌿 HennaBloom Studio 
HennaBloom Studio is a simple web app where customers can browse henna designs and book orders. 
The artist uses a private admin dashboard to manage designs—adding, editing, or deleting them. 
Built with a clean, minimalist interface and modular architecture, the app showcases real-world CRUD 
functionality, seamless frontend-backend integration. It’s built with React, Express, MongoDB, and Axios to keep everything connected and easy to use.
